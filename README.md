# MindMaze
Python coded text-based game

<h1>Summary of Mind Maze</h1>
<p>This was the final product from my <i>IT 145 - Introction to Scripting</i> course. The task assigned was to create a fully functional text-based game using Python to demonstrate control flow, user input, data structures, and basic game logic (such as inventory validation checks and directional command movement).</p>

<p>In this game, players explore different areas of their own mind - including dark halls, quiet chambers, and dreamlike spaces - collecting positive affirmations and traits like <b>resilience, clarity</b>, and <b>self-worth</b>. The ultimate goal: <b>gather all of the affirmations before encountering the villain - Imposter Syndrom</b>.</p>

<h1>:video_game: Gameplay Features</h1>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Simple directional movement (e.g. "go North", "go South")</li>
<li>Room-based exploration with unique descriptions</li>
<li>Inventory system to track collected items</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Includes item validation</li>
    </ul>
<li>Win/loss conditions based on whether all items are collected before the villain encounter</li>
<li>Starting area: <i>The Sunlit Atrium</i> (no items, just a safe introduction)</li>
</ul>
</p>
